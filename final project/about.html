        <h2>WHY IS A PERSONALITY TEST IMPORTANT?</h2>

        <p>A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individual's distinct personality traits In most
            instances, your personality will influence relationships with your family, friends, and classmates and contribute
            to your health and well-being. Teachers can administer a personality test in class to help your children
            discover their strengths and developmental needs. The driving force behind administering a personality test is
            to open up lines of communication and bring students together to have a higher appreciation for one another. A
            personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what teaching strategies will be most effective for the
            students.
        </p>

        <h3> Personality test can benefit your students by:</h3>
        <p>
            • Increasing productivity <br> • Get along better with classmates <br> • Help students realize their full
            potential <br> • Identify teaching strategies for students <br> • Help students appreciate other personality
            types
        </p>
        <p>One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality Test. This personality test asks a
            series of questions to rate your likes and dislikes. The test will then rate your personality as either a
            blue, green, orange or gold personality type. You may be a combination of two colors, but usually, a student
            will exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to type-cast a student, but it allows
            teachers to understand the personality attributes associated with various students. You will operate as one
            primary color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental factors can shift your
            personality type for short intervals. As a rule of thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes and
            keep in mind the attributes that irritate people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the first week of school. A personality test
            is a fun exercise for the class and will enable the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and activities
            for their students.
